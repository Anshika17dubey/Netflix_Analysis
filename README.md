Netflix Data Analysis Project

## <b>Introduction</b>
The Netflix Data Analysis project explores and analyzes the Netflix dataset to gain insights into its vast collection of movies and TV shows. By leveraging Python, Jupyter notebooks, and SQL, this project aims to uncover trends, patterns, and interesting information about Netflix content.

## <b>Dataset</b>
The dataset used in this project is sourced from kaggle, Netflix and includes comprehensive information about each title, including categories, release dates, cast, directors, ratings, and more. This dataset provides a rich source of information for conducting detailed analysis and exploration.

## <b>Steps Followed</b>
### Data Preparation
Cleaning and preprocessing the Netflix dataset.
Handling missing values and outlier detection.
### Data Visualization
Generating visualizations such as histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots to understand data distributions and correlations.
Examples include:
